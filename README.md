# Recursive Unzip

Very basic program for recursively unzipping zip files.

Written after I watched a friend unzipping files manually each within a zip file.
It looked maddening and so this basic utility may hopefully provide some relief from
this as it is common in 3D model assets to have multiple zip files nested.

# Usage

This is a command line application.

To install this you simply need to clone or download the repository and run `npm install`.

You can then run the script using `node recrusiveUnzip <zip-location> <output-location>`
